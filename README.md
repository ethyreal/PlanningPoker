# PlanningPoker
Simple example of an MVVM+C implementation


## Project Goals

1. Create a non trivial app using MVC as given by apple.  Build up "massive view controllers" or at least tightly coupled.  They shoudl have the following inside each UIViewController:
    - Model/Business
    - Navigation/Routing
    - Networking
2. Refactor logic item by time towards a goal of MVVM+C.  Each iteration should have a write up and release or tag marking the progression.  The goal is to have a reference to refer to later from start to finish
3. Polish well factored POC into a fully functioning MVP of Planning Poker
